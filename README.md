# SETI Public Data Server

The SETI Institute utilizes the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) to search for radio signals from intelligent life
beyond our Solar System. Nearly each night, the ATA observes radio frequencies in the ~1-10 GHz 
frequency range from particular localtions in the sky. 

Observation of a potential signal results in two pieces of data: a raw data file, called a `compamp`
or `archive-compamp`, and the preliminary analysis of the signal, which is stored as a row
in the `SignalDB` table. The raw data are the digitized time-series radio signals along two 
polarizations within a particular bandwidth for a particular location in the sky. A [SignalDB row contains the conditions and characteristics of the observation](signaldb.md),
such as the Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (DEC) celestial coordinates of the observation, an estimate of the power of the signal, primary carrier frequency, drift, signal classification,
etc., which are derived from the raw data signals.  (All RA/DEC coordinates are referenced from 
the J2000 equinox.)

<!-- For this 
project, we have stored the SignalDB on
[dashDB](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/cloud-data-services/dashdb) and the raw
`compamp` and `archive-compamp` files in 
[IBM Object Store](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/object-storage/).
 -->
We have constructed an HTTP API that allows you to access these data, which is described in this document. 

The raw data for a signal that is categorized as a `Candidate` is stored as an `archive-compamp` file, 
while all other types signals are stored as `compamp` files. An `archive-compamp` contains recorded data across the 16 subbands nearest to the signal observed 
by the ATA.  However, the `compamp` files contain just the single subband where `non-Candidate`
signals was observed. 

Right now, we are only making the `Candidate`/`archive-compamp` files and their associated
rows in the SignalDB available. 

Further enhancements to this API will provide access to `compamp` and other ways of retrieving the data.

## Full Example Usage with Python

### Introduction

The following example, done in Python, shows a typical way to use this API. 

The general flow should be something like: 

  * Find an interesting target in the sky and note the coordinates.
  * Determine if data is available for a particular point or region in the sky.
  * Get the SignalDB rows and raw data file information for that region. 
  * Get a temporary URL for the raw data file.
  * Download the data and store it.

Though it's not necessary, typically one will start by selecting an interesting target or
interesting region in the sky.  

In order to access the raw data, however, you will be required to 
have an [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net)
account. There is a limit of 10k temporary URL requests per month. 


### Select an Interesting Target

Use some kind of [source](http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog)
to find interesting expolanet coordinates. There are other websites that carry this information.
You can also just pick a region in the sky. 
[This map](http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~abel/phl/exomaps/all_stars_with_exoplanets_white.png), 
along with the `Observing Progress` link found on [https://setiquest.info](http://setiquest.info/),
may be helpful.

You'll need to know the right ascension (RA, in hours from 0.0 to 24) and declination 
(DEC, in degrees from -90.0 to 90.0) of your exoplanet/target of interest. However, the RA/DEC
values recorded in the database may not exactly match the known position of the object (at most, 
these values differ by 0.002 degrees). Or you may choose a wider region of the sky. Either way, 
we use the API to search for data within an enclosed region of the sky. 

#### Kepler 1229b

Let's look at Kepler 1229b, found here http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog.
This candidate planet has an Earth similarity index (ESI) of 0.73 (Earth = 1.0, Mars = 0.64, Jupiter = 0.12) 
and is 770 light-years away. It is the 5th highest-ranked planet by ESI.

You can take a look at this object in the sky: 
[http://simbad.cfa.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%408996422&Name=KOI-2418.01&submit=submit](http://simbad.cfa.harvard.edu/simbad/sim-id?Ident=%408996422&Name=KOI-2418.01&submit=submit)

The celestial coordinates for Kepler 1229b is RA = 19.832 and DEC = 46.997

### Query the SignalDB

Here is the example code to query our API for a region about the position of Kepler 1229b. The API
endpoint to use is [`/v1/coordinates/aca`](#celestial-coordinates-of-candidate-events). In this case,
we define a 0.004 x 0.004 box around the RA/DEC position.

```python
import requests
RA=19.832
DEC=46.997
box = 0.002

# We want this query
# http://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/coordinates/aca?ramin=19.830&ramax=19.834&decmin=46.995&decmax=46.999

params = {
  'ramin':RA-box, 'ramax':RA+box, 'decmin':DEC-box, 'decmax':DEC+box
}
r = requests.get('https://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/coordinates/aca',
    params = params)

import json
print json.dumps(r.json(), indent=1)
```

We get the following output:

```json
{
  "returned_num_rows": 1,   
  "skipped_num_rows": 0, 
  "rows": [
    {
      "dec2000deg": 46.997, 
      "number_of_rows": 392, 
      "ra2000hr": 19.832
    }
  ], 
  "total_num_rows": 1
}
```

This means we found 392 'Candidate' signals recorded while observing this planet in the SignalDB. 

##### Aside

If we expand our range of allowed RA/DEC values, we find 'Candidate' events for some nearby positions.

```
GET http://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/coordinates/aca?ramin=19.800&ramax=19.90&decmin=46.95&decmax=47.02
```

returns

```json
{
  "total_num_rows": 4,
  "skipped_num_rows": 0,
  "returned_num_rows": 4,
  "rows": [
    {
      "ra2000hr": 19.832,
      "dec2000deg": 46.997,
      "number_of_candidates": 392
    },
    { 
      "ra2000hr": 19.834,
      "dec2000deg": 46.961,
      "number_of_candidates": 370
    },
    {
      "ra2000hr": 19.856,
      "dec2000deg": 46.968,
      "number_of_candidates": 44
    },
    {
      "ra2000hr": 19.861,
      "dec2000deg": 46.965,
      "number_of_candidates": 32
    }
  ]
}
```

You may wish to extend your box further so see what you find. 

### Get SignalDB Rows

Given a particular celestial coordinate, we can obtain all of the 'Candidate' signal meta data,
as found in the SignalDB.

The endpoint to use is 
[`/v1/aca/meta/{ra}/{dec}`](#meta-data-and-location-of-candidate-events).

Continuing from the example above


```python
ra = r.json()['rows'][0]['ra2000hr']  #19.832 from above query
dec = r.json()['rows'][0]['dec2000deg'] #46.997 

r = requests.get('https://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/aca/meta/{}/{}'.format(ra, dec))

print json.dumps(r.json(), indent=1)
```

Here's what the output will look like:

```
{
 "returned_num_rows": 200, 
 "skipped_num_rows": 0, 
 "rows": [
  {
   "inttimes": 94, 
   "pperiods": 27.36000061, 
   "pol": "mixed", 
   "tgtid": 150096, 
   "sigreason": "PsPwrT", 
   "freqmhz": 6113.461883333, 
   "dec2000deg": 46.997, 
   "container": "setiCompAmp", 
   "objectname": "2014-05-20/act14944/2014-05-20_13-00-01_UTC.act14944.dx2016.id-0.L.archive-compamp", 
   "ra2000hr": 19.832, 
   "npul": 3, 
   "acttype": null, 
   "power": 50.652, 
   "widhz": 2.778, 
   "catalog": "keplerHZ", 
   "snr": 32.397, 
   "uniqueid": "kepler8ghz_14944_2016_0_2208930", 
   "beamno": 2, 
   "sigclass": "Cand", 
   "sigtyp": "Pul", 
   "tscpeldeg": 78.558, 
   "drifthzs": -1.055, 
   "candreason": "Confrm", 
   "time": "2014-05-20T12:59:55Z", 
   "tscpazdeg": 307.339
  }, 
  ...
  "total_num_rows": 392
}
```

The maximum return limit is 200 rows per query. The `total_num_rows` tells you there are 392 rows. To get the rest, you'll need to use the `?skip=200` optional
URL parameter. For example

```python 
r = requests.get('https://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/aca/meta/{}/{}?skip=200'.format(ra, dec)
rows = r.json()['rows']
```

Searching through the results from this particular example, one thing you'll notice is that while there are 392
'Candidate' signals found in the SignalDB, it doesn't mean there are 392 raw data files. *There
will be duplicates.* So you'll need to sort through them appropriately. If you do not and you use
the same raw data multiple times within a machine-learning algorithm (to extract a set of features, 
for example), you'll likely corrupt your results. 

An easy way to reorder your results by the raw data file is with a `groupby`. For example

```python
import itertools

rows = sorted(rows, key=lambda row:row['container'] + '-' + row['objectname'])

#grl is a list of (key, [rows])
grl = [(k,list(g)) for k,g in itertools.groupby(rows, lambda row:row['container'] + '-' + row['objectname'])]

# equivalently in Spark. `sc` is a SparkContext object
rdd = sc.parallelize(rows)
rdd = rdd.groupBy(lambda row: row['container'] + '-' + row['objectname']) 
```

You'll also notice there multiple files that have the same SignalDB, but with names that differ only
by a `L` or `R`. The ATA records signals along the horizontal and veritcal polarizations 
(relative to the ATA's orientation to the Earth). The initial intent, however, was to record the
left- and right-circularly polarized signals. This was not feasible for technical reasons, but 
the naming convention stuck. The horizontal and vertical components of the signal are stored in the 
`L` and `R` files, respectively.

The location of the raw data is stored in an
[IBM Object Store available on Bluemix](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2015/10/20/getting-started-with-bluemix-object-storage/).

In order to access those  data files, one must first request a temporary URL.

NB: We separate the steps between getting the SignalDB row and container/objectname for the raw data
file and getting a URL to the raw data file for a reason. Since downloading and analyzing the
raw data can be an expensive operation, making these steps separate gives your analysis the
opportunity to select only data, based on the values in SignalDB, that may be interesting. For example,
you may wish to consider only data that have a particular Signal-To-Noise ratio (SNR is one of the values
in SignalDB). Secondly, we issue temporary URLs that expire one hour after you've requested
the URL, which allows us to control usage. 

##### Spacecraft

Since spacecraft do not have a fixed RA/DEC value, we have a special endpoint, 
[`/v1/aca/meta/spacecraft`](#meta-data-and-location-of-candidate-events-for-spacecraft).

Use this endpoint just as you would the `/v1/aca/meta/{ra}/{dec}`. The returned JSON will have
the same schema. 


### Temporary URLs and Data Storage

The temporary URLs are obtained with the
[`/v1/data/url/{containter}/{objectname}`](#temporary-url-for-raw-data) 
endpoint. *These temporary URLs, by default, are valid for only one hour.* You must consider this
when obtaining the URLs and retrieving the data. 

#### Access Tokens

In order to request a temporary URL, however, you must supply an `access_token` as a query
parameter to the request. An `access_token` can
only be obtained if you have an account on [IBM Bluemix](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/) 
or [IBM Data Science Experience](http://datascience.ibm.com/).

You can obtain a token by clicking here and logging into your account.

https://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/token

You are limited to 10,000 temporary URLs per month. However, if you have a compelling reason (a good 
idea for an analysis), you can [contact us](contact_us.md) and have your limited increased. 

```python
param = {'access_token':'1234567890abcdefg'}

def get_temp_url(row):
  
  turl = 'https://setigopublic.mybluemix.net/v1/data/url/{}/{}'.format(row[0], row[1])
  r = requests.get(turl, params=params)

  return (r.status_code, r.json()['temp_url'], row[0], row[1])

temp_urls = map(get_temp_url, data_paths)
```

[With the temporary URL, we can now download, store and analyze the data file](notebooks).
